This is a repo that contains training models created while i was learning and practising Machine Learning models.
These are simple and direct implementation of of basic algorithms that a person comes across when he or she is starting with Machine Leaarning.
An attempt has been made to keep it a supdated as posible for example outdated libraries has been discarded and updated ones have beeen used in place of them
despite the sincere effort of keeping the files updated there is a chance of some of the libraries getting outdated overtime.
